# Covid-19 App WITHE REACT.JS

A flexible and responsive carousel component for react

## How to Use ?

I have used Coronavirus's API in it which keeps the data of the entire country. And that's how I put it in the table of HTML (Like). In the proof below, the screenshots of which the pictures are given....

### Installing

# Using npm:

`$ npm install axios`

# Using bower:

`$ bower install axios`

# Using yarn:

`$ yarn add axios`

## NOTE: 
  async/await is part of ECMAScript 2017 and is not supported in Internet Explorer and older browsers, so use with caution.
  
### Usage

```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```
  
 

ith the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
